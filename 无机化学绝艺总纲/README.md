`qyxf-book` is a LaTeX document class (template) developed by *Qian Yuan Xue Fu* (QYXF), a student club of *Xi'an Jiaotong University* (XJTU). Up to now, the template is applied in several academic counseling materials ("course helpers") written by members of QYXF, including:

- Solutions to University Physics: <https://qyxf.site/latest/大物题解（上）.pdf>
- Notes on Computing Methods: <https://qyxf.site/latest/计算方法撷英-v1.1.pdf>
- Guide to Computer Programming: <https://qyxf.site/latest/计算机设计程序指南.pdf>

The document class used to be a part of the macro set `qyxf-sets`, which is deprecated due to the difficulties of using doc/docstrip utility. Currently, `qyxf-book` is developed and maintained independently and is licensed with MIT. Forks and improvements are welcomed through our source code repository:

- Gitee: <https://gitee.com/qyxf/qyxf-book/>
- GitHub: <https://github.com/qyxf/qyxf-book/>
